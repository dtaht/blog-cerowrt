Twas a dark and stormy night. I was under pressure from my employer to
produce results, I was getting nowhere, and I was freezing to death in
the [yurtlab](/tags/lab). The existing heater was inadequate (there's no
insulation there - it's my "summer" residence), and even wrapping myself
with an electric blanket was not enough. I can't remember the exact date
right now, it was 3? 4? years ago, at around this time, which is why I
think I'm flashing on this event so much this week.

So I finally arranged with my (now-ex)gf (she didn't much care for all the
blinkenlights and keyboard clicking I do, thus the "ex") to take me and my gear in, to her apartment in San Francisco. I packed up the lab - 15 computers -
something like 5 laptops, 3 servers - some *expensive* prototype gear I
was testing with, and a bunch of routers, my toolkits - got it all into
the car in the pouring rain and headed up to San Francisco in the hope
that I could resume there.

It took 3 hours to get up there, and instead of going straight home, I
was exhausted by the packing, rain and traffic, so I parked my car in
golden gate park, and we went to dinner so I could recharge enough to
haul it all up 3 flights of stairs.

An hour later I returned to find my car smashed open, and everything I'd
tossed in the back, stolen. We made a police report... but nothing was
ever found again.

I've never really recovered from this. I had 3 decades worth of emacs
customizations, my accounting system, my time management system, two
fiction books (over 15 years) I'd made a start at writing, 2 years of
notes and test data on the early stages of our explorations into the
bufferbloat problem (where I'd swallowed 50 years of queue and network
theory), my entire nicaraguan diary both personal and of the WISP6
project, my email server, my database server - my 8TB of all my music
created (and my recordings of others)in the last decade in their
original multitrack 96khz 24 bit ardour format - and years worth of
dictation that I hadn't got around to typing up - all stolen.

Sure, I had a backup of most of that - on one of the other computers that
was part of the stolen bundle. I actually had like 7 copies of the
.emacs.d dir, in particular - but not a whole lot of it offsite. Months
prior to this my main machine in the cloud had failed too with a busted
raid array.

I got pretty scarred from this experience and found it really hard to
write for a while. Or, for that matter, compose. Or think. And my
ability to function and multitask effectively within multiple projects
collapsed. I felt extreme guilt for losing the prototype hardware and
basically dropped out - in addition: after losing all the tools I used
to be productive with in the first place I was feeling like my hands
were cut off.

Since then - well, I rigorously use git now. (some of my stuff was so
old as to be in rcs!!) Everything important is not only backed up to my
personal servers in the cloud but published on the web, too. I've
gradually evolved toke's emacs configuration into something I kind of
like (but would have to spend months getting something perfect)

Still, I flail a lot, and I feel perpetually disorganized, trying to use
tools that are inappropriate for managing my life's context switches.
Finger memory for dozens of function keys and dozens of other custom
keystrokes, in various emacs modes, was wiped out. My tight integration
of emacs with my other tools, was gone. (In particular I used org-mode's
"remind mode", a lot, for nearly everything), and gnus.

I haven't managed to sit down and record a note of music since, either.
It hurts too much to think of all the labor lost - particularly all the
midi stuff that I'd labored so many hours over, making perfect. As audio
tracks are intensely bandwidth and storage intensive, and also often
intensely personal - the prospect of having them in the cloud where
anyone could get them bothers me. I'd held a lot of this stuff close for
a reason.

If I ever get the months put together to analyze what I'm doing wrong
and correct it, and automate it, again, I'd be a lot happier and more
productive person. Instead I just keep up the repetitive clicking on
random windows instead of automating it. But swallowing emacs lisp
to the extent I once knew it, has proved hard. I only get a few hours
here and there to backfill, and keep flashing on what I'm trying to
recreate and how hard it was to create in the first place.

As it is, only in the last year or so, have I healed enough to start
composing music again, and have my mind not shift back to all I lost while
trying to play something half remembered, or old. I really regret not
backing up the midi tracks in particular. Those were so lightweight
compared to everything else... and so hard to make so perfect.

I keep trying new web tools (for example I rather like hugo, but
swapping out textile and org-mode for markdown has come unnaturally).

...

Don't let this happen to you. Keep offsite backups. Make sure they are
current... and don't park in GGP with your lifes work in the backseat of
a car no matter how tired you are!

It's also an example of cognitive collapse - had I internalized what
that RAID box in the cloud did for me before it broke - had I not been so
tired when I got to SF - everything would have been fine.

This was probably the second most miserable day in my life, the
aftereffects of which extended essentially for years now, and I still
can't bring myself to talk about the worst day in my life - 30 years
later.

These past few months I've found myself wanting to write down those
first two years of the early bufferbloat exploration, so I can explain
everything that's happened since - as part of my PHD thesis - and going
through flashback after flashback of that terrible night instead.

Maybe after writing this down and reviewing my email - all that's left -
from that time period, bits and pieces that I scarcely remember will
surface. Maybe I'll be able to fix that raid array to some extent,
someday, too.

I do hope that whoever stole and sold my !@#! stuff got some good drugs
out of it and a few days worth of high. I am sometimes angry enough to
hope they ODed and angry at myself for being so angry.
