Once upon a time I was asked by a clueless HR person to describe what
structured programming was. By that point in the interview I'd decided
I didn't want that job and started riffing.

Structured programming, I said, is about how you plan your day in a world
of shared cubical space. You have to time when you tackle the most complicated
coding for when you were sure you wouldn't be interrupted - either early
in the morning, or late at night, when there was nobody there. 

She just wrote down what I said, which took all the fun out of it.
