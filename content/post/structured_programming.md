Once upon a time I was asked by a clueless HR person to describe what
structured programming was. By that point in the interview I'd decided
I didn't want that job and started riffing.

Structured programming, I said, is about how you plan your day in a world
of shared cubical space. You have to time when you tackle the most complicated
coding for when you were sure you wouldn't be interrupted - either early
in the morning, or late at night, when there was nobody there. 

She just wrote down what I said, which took all the fun out of it.

Most of my greatest exploits in programming have happened over a long
holiday - christmas and easter being the two that stand out. I've had quite a 
few "long weekends" that were just awesome... and I've
also had several "vacations" that were in the end more productive for
me than the entire year was before it.

I don't know what this means - that the lowered stress level of not getting a 100 emails a day leads to this? - or nobody in the office ever interrupting... or family time leads to clearer thinking? 

I'm presently at an average number of "lines per day" that is nearly zero. 
I haven't been in a zone for months, and to sit here, struggling to write
a sentence, when I feel like every day I should be pounding out far, far more,
has been frustrating. I feel burnt to a crisp, tired, my brain worn smooth.

I keep wondering what would happen if I logged out long enough
to take a sabbatical and ignored the world for a few months. I increasingly
feel that with all the main things we set out to solve in the bufferbloat
project now solved, and the [make-wifi-fast](https://lwn.net/Articles/705884/) code entering mainline linux - that it might be time to find out.

I keep thinking I'd like to write a [Mill emulator](http://www.millcomputing.com), in particular, or tackle 87+ unfinished blog entries, work on a PHD thesis, or write something in Go.

I've struggled these past months with an incredibly complex codebase,
and the mere prospect of starting something new, from scratch, not related
to bufferbloat, is relaxing... and it's sort of about how to structure programming after all...

... as is merely getting in a few boat drinks and catching up on some good
novels. Ah well. Christmas is Nigh! See you on the other side!

Enjoy your wifi!
