Dear DSL industry - chipmakers and ISPs - you are missing out on an opportunity
to remain relevant. 

Your users

It's not your fault, entirely - shifts in the market towards higher bandwidths
- things like IW10, 

# Chipmakers

And you're blowing it. A technique arrived to moderate the behaviof the
tx-ring *back in 2011* that would completely eliminate all this latency
and allow you to hand the smarter stuff off to other techniques already
well established in the linux kernel.

It would imply adding less than 50 lines of code to your firmware to
manage the buffers appropriately. Why haven't you shipped - on any old
or new product - a fix?

What is it? All the buyouts? Have you lost the original sources? Does the
NSA have a lock on how it works? Or other regulatory issues? Or: Did 
the original coder go mad?

I am pretty sure, that if I could just find that guy - probably living under
a bridge somewhere - within a couple beers, we'd be able to make the same vast
improvement in DSL performance that we just made in wifi.

But... nooo... you'd rather litigate, or hire lawyers to advocate for
dismembering net neutrality - than sink one dollar into improving the
technology you will be continuing to ship to 100s of millions of customers
for the next 20 years.

I think there is enormous pent-up demand for better DSL, and this is the
simplest, cheapest, way, to deliver a better version to areas of the world
that will never be upgraded to fiber, and lack cable.

underserved remote areas, 

can all be fixed
