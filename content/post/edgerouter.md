I've had an edgerouter X for ages.

Anyway, I was scanning my network for another device and found one
that responded to ping. Thankfully attempting to login showed the
ULA disclaimer message, I remembered the password....

and great. I've had this thing plugged in, glowing away, for months,
now, and I haven't had much to do with it.

Problem is that although I've been told, multiple times, how to compile
stuff for it, it's beyond me to fire up qemu.

I *like* very much that it has a good routing protocol implementation
and it's an object lesson to me that off-the-shelf products don't
have babel support by default. I sure wish it was available tho,
because integrating it into my network would be easier.

I gave it a fixed ip address (which eliminated it from dynamic dns)
and lost it.

It also lacks dhcp-pd, sm

Now... off to find the box that I had lost earlier this week.
